# General
This is the official repo of the onion service 'OnionCheck': 

> http://4vklnppwesmtro2ekmteprzdxy7cein64cbst4upik3movpwkjtcbxad.onion:81


## What is this?

Well, it is common that some onion websites mirrors are offline because of heavy DDoS. What happen after is that, the owners of the services usually release a lot of new mirrors, but not all of them are online and you'll have to check one by one while you could be doing something else. So this tool will atuomate all of that for you! :D

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is similar to the one from dark.fail. As they say:

>Always fast, one server request. No tracking ever, no javascript.

Except that we run javascript server-side since this app is builded on node js, for more information check out the sourcecode! We believe that DDoSing websites, that protect free speech and freedom of the press and muting people in countries where those rights are non-existent, is a big crime against human rights. Tools such as dark.fail and OnionCheck exist to help protect such rights online.
